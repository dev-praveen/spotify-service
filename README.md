# spotify-service
This project uses JDK 17 and gradle as a build tool and I use IntellIJ IDEA to run the application in local.

The aim of this project to make use of spotify API's which are secured with oauth2.0

Right now I am facing some issues with spring doc open api which is not allowing me to open up the open api documentation
URL: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

Appreciate ideas.

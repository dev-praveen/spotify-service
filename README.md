# spotify-service
This project uses JDK 17 and gradle as a build tool and I use IntellIJ IDEA to run the application in local.

The aim of this project is to make use of spotify API's which are secured with oauth2.0 (client credentials flow)

Right now I am facing some issues with spring doc open api, which is not allowing me to open up the open api documentation from browser.
URL: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

How should I configure my SecurityConfig to allow swagger-ui documentation to open up ?

Appreciate ideas.
